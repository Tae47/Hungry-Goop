# HUNGRY GOOP

- A game about feeding a goop (slime).

The goop is YOURS! :TaePog:<br>
Track your IRL meals ! (Yes, you have to eat REAL LIFE FOOD) :blueCookie:<br>
Goop gets fed and spits out resources based on *what you eat*. :bluejerksmirk:<br>


You craft a base. The base collects extra resources.  :ONG:<br>
THEN! You use resources to set up defenses. A glooming threat is on its way (if you want it to be). :starewaiting:<br>
You can choose to be attacked by enemies (don't know what kind yet but yeah)<br>
The harder difficulty you pick, the more you stand to gain. If you lose, you don't lose anything, you just don't gain anything either.<br>
IF YOU WIN YOU GET COSMETICS AND SHIT!  :tf2_dear_god: <br>
Cosmetics which you can put on your goop! :tf2_soldier_conga: <br>
Not just cosmetics though. You can get goop shapes, wigs, eyes, random objects to stick inside or on your goop, paints, dyes, modeling tools :scream:, and much more !<br>
THEN you fight your friends in a battle of mimicry! :pregnant_man: <br>
You outfit and shape your goop to match a randomly picked person, character, or object. AND WHOEVER WINS...... is like cool and stuff so yeah that's the game. :proud: <br>


TL:DR<br>
Think macro and calorie tracker X tower defense X idle game X Mii Maker.<br>
Yeag





Now I'mma be real,<br>
this is mainly just to get me motivated to stay on a diet, and I don't expect you guys to play it.<br>
But I'll try to make sure the dieting goes both ways !!<br>
Meaning if you want to bulk, you can choose to bulk!<br>
If you want to lose weight, choose whatever method you want to do that !<br>
If you don't care, you can STILL PLAY !!! Just log your meals or water intake, and you'll be rewarded. Doesn't matter what you eat or drink ! You can cheat too! Nothing is sent to any server or validated, everything is on YOUR PC! (but don't cheat, that's just mean. Honors system)<br>

I'll try to make it actually fun :P<br>
You'll mainly be rewarded for consistency. Not hitting your goals. This should deter cheating anyways, since there's not much of a point. But if you do consistently log and hit your goals, you might get more cosmetics !!<br>
So what do y'all think? :3<br>












# HERE'S WHAT I NEED TO DO:

:white_large_square: You drag parts of goop out to the towers so they actually shoot or do stuff, but that makes goop smaller, and that limits you<br>
