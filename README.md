# HUNGRY GOOP

- A game about feeding a goop (slime).

The goop is YOURS! :TaePog: 
Track your IRL meals ! (Yes, you have to eat REAL LIFE FOOD) :blueCookie: 
Goop gets fed and spits out resources based on *what you eat*. :bluejerksmirk: 

You craft a base. The base collects extra resources.  :ONG: 
THEN! You use resources to set up defenses. A glooming threat is on its way (if you want it to be). :starewaiting: 
You can choose to be attacked by enemies (don't know what kind yet but yeah)
The harder difficulty you pick, the more you stand to gain. If you lose, you don't lose anything, you just don't gain anything either.
IF YOU WIN YOU GET COSMETICS AND SHIT!  :tf2_dear_god: 
Cosmetics which you can put on your goop! :tf2_soldier_conga: 
Not just cosmetics though. You can get goop shapes, wigs, eyes, random objects to stick inside or on your goop, paints, dyes, modeling tools :scream:, and much more !
THEN you fight your friends in a battle of mimicry! :pregnant_man: 
You outfit and shape your goop to match a randomly picked person, character, or object. AND WHOEVER WINS...... is like cool and stuff so yeah that's the game. :proud: 


TL:DR
Think macro and calorie tracker X tower defense X idle game X Mii Maker.
Yeag





Now I'mma be real,
this is mainly just to get me motivated to stay on a diet, and I don't expect you guys to play it.
But I'll try to make sure the dieting goes both ways !!
Meaning if you want to bulk, you can choose to bulk!
If you want to lose weight, choose whatever method you want to do that !
If you don't care, you can STILL PLAY !!! Just log your meals or water intake, and you'll be rewarded. Doesn't matter what you eat or drink ! You can cheat too! Nothing is sent to any server or validated, everything is on YOUR PC! (but don't cheat, that's just mean. Honors system)

I'll try to make it actually fun :P
You'll mainly be rewarded for consistency. Not hitting your goals. This should deter cheating anyways, since there's not much of a point. But if you do consistently log and hit your goals, you might get more cosmetics !!
So what do y'all think? :3
