# HERE'S WHAT I NEED TO DO:

## Get the main tracking logic working:
:white_large_square: A button for feeding goop
:white_large_square: Input either an ingredient, a recipe, or macros!
:white_large_square: A button for adding a new food for easier input in the future
:white_large_square: Each food needs a category set (Protein, Veggies, Dairy, Fats, Carbs, Drink)
:white_large_square: JSON saving of food tracking and stuff
:white_large_square: A button for creating a recipe to be stored for later use
:white_large_square: Weight tracking
:white_large_square: Day cycle so the game knows when it's a new day, and saves data PER DAY
:white_large_square: Bars that fill up showing current daily intake and how far you are from goals
:white_large_square: Settings menu to set up your goals
:white_large_square: Detect when you're close to your target (for rewards)
:white_large_square: Create saving activites that you can do to still get rewards even when missing your target
:white_large_square: 3 random challenges when going over your limit (physical, social, creative, whatever) and you pick which one you want to do.
:white_large_square: Add a cap for max resources daily (tie it to your goals?)
:white_large_square: Get resources from meals to work
:white_large_square: Inventory system for your resources

## Slime customizer:
:white_large_square: Make slime customizer. Cool slime shader with color change functionality if you get dyes.
:white_large_square: use vertex maps / height maps to add slime shapes!
:white_large_square: Add some simple cosmetics
:white_large_square: Animate the slime doing simple idle stuff
:white_large_square: make it react to logging !
:white_large_square: Make a screen for customizing slime cosmetics and facial features
:white_large_square: Shit we need to be able to save and load custom slime looks
:white_large_square: Maybe a save menu for saving outfits?
:white_large_square: Make a brush tool (high-tier item) that allows player to DRAW a height map ON slime mesh by clicking and dragging !!!
:white_large_square: Brush size and strength controls
:white_large_square: Smooth and flatten tools (this gon' be hard)
:white_large_square: Reset button (with confirmation)

## Base builder + resource gathering:
:white_large_square: Machines and ore nodes / crops and shit
:white_large_square: Lumber mill, quarry, forge, refinery, and crafting (maybe goop will craft for you inside their belly?)
:white_large_square: Isometric grid based base building
:white_large_square: build, delete, edit, move, whatevs
:white_large_square: Click a building, and it shows info?
:white_large_square: Display resources
:white_large_square: SAVE YOUR BASE TO JSON!!!

## Tower defense:
:white_large_square: Make simple enemy
:white_large_square: Wave spawning system
:white_large_square: Pathfinding (oh god)
:white_large_square: Tower types (Yay defenses (clash of clans idk))
:white_large_square: Towers need slime troops, so keep goop well fed!
:white_large_square: You drag parts of goop out to the towers so they actually shoot or do stuff, but that makes goop smaller, and that limits you
:white_large_square: Enemies take damage (so does your base and stuff, but it only dies for the duration of the round)
:white_large_square: Winning screen! 
:white_large_square: Losing screen :(
:white_large_square: Difficulty levels with different enemies and rewards
:white_large_square: Max 3 rounds per day
:white_large_square: Give rewards when you win (seperate inventory for unlocks and cosmetics. Resources are managed on their own)
:white_large_square: Enemy animations
:white_large_square: Attack animations for towers

## Even more cosmetics:
:white_large_square: Eyes, mouths, eyebrows, paints (use once), paintbrushes (use once), hats, objects to stick on or inside goop, noses, tattoos.
:white_large_square: Patterns?
:white_large_square: Background themes

## Data:
:white_large_square: Show current logging streak on main screen
:white_large_square: Give premium currency for streaks
:white_large_square: Milestone rewards /week, month, whatever)
:white_large_square: Accuracy rewards (be close to your targets for extra resources)
:white_large_square: Graphs for weight or other cool data
:white_large_square: Give cosmetics for weekly performance

## Polish and Social:
:white_large_square: Import/Export character designs using codes?
:white_large_square: Make mimicry minigame (maybe, but I don't wanna do networking)
:white_large_square: Make cute dialogue (thanks Mo for helping me spell dialogue)
:white_large_square: Music???
:white_large_square: Sound effects !!

## NICE TO HAVES:

:white_large_square: Send notifications? (still... phone)
:white_large_square: Pickles
